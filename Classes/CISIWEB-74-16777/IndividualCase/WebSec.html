<h3>Browser data retrieved via Javascript</h3>
Because you are using a web browser don't think you are safe on the internet and anonoymous. Many things can be determined information from and about and the web browser.
<br>
<br>
Since there are new ways to gather this data the old browser check usually doesn't work, returning only Netscape:
<ul id="insecureinfo_appName"></ul>
Information can be gathered like what platform you're running on:
<ul id="insecureinfo_platform"></ul>
<BR>
How wide your screen is:
<ul id="insecureinfo_width"></ul>
<BR>
How tall your screen is:
<ul id="insecureinfo_height"></ul>
<BR>
How much color you're dealing with (color depth):
<ul id="insecureinfo_colorDepth"></ul>
<BR>
I can even retrieve your user agent which helps identify your browser and version and sometimes more operating sytem information than above
<ul id="insecureinfo_userAgent"></ul>
<BR>
As a bonus I even can determine if you have cookies enabled or not, is it true of false? It's most definitely

<ul id="insecureinfo_cookieenabled"></ul>
