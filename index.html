<p>Welcome to my super duper HTML page.</p>

<p>Ok, maybe not super duper, but just a simple markup for this assignment. I'm writing it all in notepad (thus the bottom tag line) and doing some debugging if necessary with the developer tools in the browser.</p>

<p>Anywya, back to me. I am here at Chaffey working on my Computer Information Systems degree. This is after quite a long hiatus (as mentioned in my intro video). Hopefully I'll graduate before my daughter, we'll see. I am again taking a large load of classes (7 this semester). I'm also the current president of the Chaffey Cyber Security club and welcome anyone to come check it out (even if that's not your major).</p>

<p>Outside of school I have a wide range of interests that while I think it makes me agreeable others might say it keeps me indecisive.</p>

<p>I have a daughter who is also in college.</p>




<p>While I do enjoy the outdoors that tree was one of the least descript places I thought I could take a picture. Interestingly it was grown form a free sapling at the LA County fair and has since thrived and grown much taller than the original maybe 18 inches or so it was.
</p>






<p>I've been working in the tech industry for some time, but have taken this chance to return to my studies and complete my degree. I've been out for a long, LONG time. I think when you have classes that are no longer offered you should get the option to drop them from your transcript.
